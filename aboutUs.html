      <p>About a year ago we adopted our first dog, and added a third puppers to our family. Bowie was a two year old GSD, and she hadn't been given the best start in life.
        She was under weight due to being bounced around foster homes without no real time to adjust. She'd spent most of her life in chain-link run with no access to
        other dogs or people. She never learned how to play.
      </p>
      <p> Left alone for long periods when her owner was away, the only interactions she had were always through her run's fencing. She didn't know how to behave, and would often
          pee herself when someone raised their voice to tell her to stop (a word no one ever took the time to explain). We welcomed her in, and for a few weeks we couldn't believe
          how quickly she was adjusting, and getting on Better and better with our other dogs. Boots the seven year old Lab, and our other GSD Panda who was four at the time.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/Images/three-on-bed.jpg" class="img-thumbnail scaleDown" alt="Three dogs on a bed">
      <p> As you may have guessed things went sideways for us. Bowie and Panda got into a huge fight over a toy and my partner had to interject. Both GSD's needed the vet and my partner 
          ended up at the doctors with serious injuries. We agonised over what to do, but quickly decided we'd try everything we could before giving up either Bowie or Panda.
      </p>
      <p> Our vet told us about Shauna (a dog behaviouralist). She absolutely blew us away at our first meeting. She instantly knew everything we'd been doing wrong, and had practical solutions.

# Project Name: A better Puppers : (Never give up! Never surrender!)

## Project aim

The site's puprose is to provide information on general canine health. Be that physical, mental or social. Through a series of responsive questionaires we evalute dietery needs, optimal excercise regimes and appropriate socilaisation requirements.
The aim is to help onwers learn through simple changes they can make to their pets everyday life. We also offer a wide range of discounted / added-value experiances, equipment and custom programs depending on breed or specific issues. 

What separates the site from others is our 'Pet First' approach. Above all else our goal is wider awaremness of the simple things we can all do to improve our pet's life. 

our Secondary objective is to grow a community using added value and pulling from external partners to offer a varied range of services to those in need of more than the basic information.

 * Achieved - VERIFY!


## UX

#### Strategy & Scope planes
The website is targeted at pet owners in need of advice and initially directs them to the three most commen problems.
* Weight
* Socialsation
* Excercise

The site offers simple first stepos to tackling each issue and offers increased help if needed via sign ups and FAQ pages.

The above categories and broekn down further for new or experiance owners, puppy care or second chance warriors adopting their first pet. 

In terms of scope the current site was kept conscise so as not to overwhelm already worried owners. 

## User Experiance 1
### Question: 
"My pet is over weight, even though I'm feeding him exactly what his food says I should."

### Answer: 
"While the feeding programs on food producer packaging is often helpful it is a guide only, and won;t always suit individual pets's needs. Upon answering some basic questions about your pet we can help with a custom feeding schedule to get him or her back on track."

[Site Response](https:#)

## User Experinace 2
### Question: 
"My dog is overly agressive towards other dogs, regardless of tehir size, and I'm afarid he'll get himself hurt, or hurt someone else."

### Answer: 
"The site aims to explain, in digestible terms, how the canine mind works, and why the dog may be reacting in certain ways. Again we require some basic information, and we push for owners to be honest with us and themselves for the betterment of their furry cxompanion."

## User Experiance 3
### Question: 
"I walk my dog everyday but she still has boundless energy, and when I leave her alone she destroys furniture and anythign else she can get a hold of."

### Answer:
"The site allows users to descibe their walking habbits, lenght, on/off leash, time of daye and what all that could mean. Again we rely on, and implore the user for, honesty. Using custom caluations we can get the owner on the right track and where extra help is required we have options available for house calls or custom tutorship from a real expert."

### Wireframes
#### The Structure & Skeleton planes
In keeping with the uncomplicated approach agreed upon in our Scope plane, the initial wireframes were created
with consistency in mind so each advancing page's style follows the previous.

_Note:_ First draft wireframe pdfâ€™s are included in this project. The main variation from which was the addition of mirroring cards to both the 'index' and 'things we like' pages in keeping with our Structure & Skeleton planes ideals.


* [index](wireframe/wireframe-index-first-draft.pdf)
* [over-forty](wireframe/wireframe-over-forty-first-draft.pdf)
* [under-forty](wireframe/wireframe-under-forty-first-draft.pdf)
* [sign-me-up](wireframe/wireframe-sign-me-up-first-draft.pdf)
* [things-we-like](wireframe/wireframe-things-we-like-first-draft.pdf)

## Features
### The Surface Plane
Overall the site is responsive and scales with user screen size. 

The site follows a succinct colour theme of **Orange** (#ff4800c5) paired with **Black** throughout,
these colours are inchanged periodically to avoid visual fatigue. 

The lead colurs are accompanied by headers and footers splashed **Pale Green** (#c6e0c1) to naturally border the pages, 
and a single font is used globally to maintain cohesiveness.

### Existing Features
* Index : Features a background image repeated throughout. Cards with images from Bootstrap. Quotes which follow a fixed style but vary in text. Info on all [here](#credits). There are links at page end to promt users deeper into the site. 
* Forty + : Contains a compact list of suggestions based on users selected age group. Page end contains a link to sign up.
* Forty - : Mirroring the 'Forty +' here we display an altered list of suggestions based on users selected age group. Page end contains a link to sign up.
* Sign Me Up : we offer a quick and easy sign up, requiring only an email address and confirmation the user has read our disclaimer which is linked in the form. We also provide an optional space to share addition information. Page end contains a link to further information on the 'Things We Like' page.
* Things We Like : The information is organised into cards with images. Info on all [here](#credits). There is also a minor push to sign up via a link at page top-right.
* Footer : Links provided to fictional social medias.

### Features left to implement 
* Sign Me Up: We would like to allow users sign up in full on this page by implementing some back-end structure and incorporating a secure direct payment method.

### Responsiveness
#### Screen sizes
I used Google Chrome's Responsive Viewer found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb).
The following are exerts from three tests.
##### Test @ 300 x 567 
![300*576](screenshots/300x576.png)

##### Test @ 320 x 635

### Performance
#### Lighthouse tests - Mobile

##### Lighthouse Initial mobile test highlighted issues such as:
* Oversized cards.
* Duplicate Bootstrap links.
* Missing labels in footer icons
![Mobile first run](screenshots/mobile-first-run.png)

##### Using Image Magick I reduced the sizes by 50%. Also corrected the duplicate links and footer icons.
![Mobile final run](screenshots/mobile-final-run.png)

##### Lighthouse Mobile overall results

I received inspiration for this project from Code Institute -Love Running- tutorial, which is why I opted for background images behind the header quotes, and a neat footer.

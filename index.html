      <h3>Our Story   <a class="smallText" href="#skip">(Skip to the end)</a></h3>
      <p>About a year ago we adopted our first dog, and added a third puppers to our family. Bowie was a two year old GSD, and she hadn't been given the best start in life.
        She was under weight due to being bounced around foster homes without no real time to adjust. She'd spent most of her life in chain-link run with no access to
        other dogs or people. She never learned how to play.
      </p>
      <p> Left alone for long periods when her owner was away, the only interactions she had were always through her run's fencing. She didn't know how to behave, and would often
          pee herself when someone raised their voice to tell her to stop (a word no one ever took the time to explain). We welcomed her in, and for a few weeks we couldn't believe
          how quickly she was adjusting, and getting on Better and better with our other dogs. Boots the seven year old Lab, and our other GSD Panda who was four at the time.
      </p>
      <p> We have vidoes of all three playing in the yard during the snow, and relaxing together in the shade on hot days. In our ignorance we congratulated ourselves on a job well done. 
          A whole year had passed before things went badly awry. I was at work when a fight broke out between the GSD's Bowie and Panda. My partner intervened, which everyone says you shouldn't,
          but when you see your pets attacking each other there are few who'd stand idly by. 
      </p>
      <p> She managed to get them separated, not without getting bit a few times herself. She locked Bowie outside and dragged Panda to the sitting room. Bloodied, and crying, she called me.
          My heart sank when I'd heard what happened. I raced home, there was blood all over the kitchen floor and my partner was tending to her wounds in the bathroom. After making sure she was okay,
          I checked on Panda, she was still rattling from the firght. GSD or not, our little Panda bear was much more of a lover than a fighter. Panda had a deep gash on her front paw and needed sticthes.
          Outside I check Bowie, she was covered in red, and bruised all over. She trembled when I came close to examine her.
      </p>
      <p> Both neded the vet, sticthes, cones and antibiotics. My partner needed a tetnus shot. As callous as it sounds, the injuries were the easy part. What to do next was what haunted us.
          To this day it's not clear who started it, and to be honest, now that we know better, it doesn't matter. We'd had Panda since she was a puppy, and Bowie only a short year. We actually debated
          giving up Panda because she'd be easier to rehome. She was great with kids, super friendly and always playful.
     </p>
     <p> Bowie, on the otherhand, could be brutish with new people and other dogs. She wasn't as obedient as Panda, and she'd been moved on before by previous owners and foster parents. So...
